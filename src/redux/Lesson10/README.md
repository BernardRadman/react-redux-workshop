### Lesson Ten - Let's wrap it up

Using what we've previously learned, expand your shopping application so that it has the following functionalities:
* A user needs to be able to buy the items. The shopping cart should clear after buying, however the system needs to know about each user transaction. (In other words implement simple transaction history).
* A user needs to be able to give up on shopping, but in that case the system only clears the cart.

In addition, if you thought this was simple, add your own functionality or come talk to me! :smile:
