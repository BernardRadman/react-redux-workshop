### Lesson Five - Quiz 

Being a very introverted creature you are, you decide it's time to create an app for those late night introvert hangouts!
So, using all you've learned so far, create a quiz app for your friends. You have total freedom, but need to follow a few simple rules:
* Only one question should appear on screen.
* The user can go back and forward and should have an indicator of which question he is on.
* After finishing the quiz (perhaps a button to confirm choices?), the user should be shown his/her score.
